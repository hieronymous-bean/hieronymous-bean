# Hello :robot:
The intention here is for this to serve as a centralized repository for any resources, solutions, or materials that I find useful enough to share. 
I'm also intending to use this as a mouthpiece for catharsis, with the goal of [hopefully] achieving some sort of satisfaction through creating. 
I've definitely accumulated a wide swath of knowledge over the past decade or so, and am always working on some project or another, so I'll attempt to document some of it for longevity.

Here are some projects that I'm actively developing:

# :cactus: Standalone Applications
#### Borges 
Document organizer and text editor focusing 

### Doughnet (aka Cachemoney)
Personal finance application merging financial wellness with open source. 

### Schemer
Application for designing database schema, mapping relationships, and prototyping models. 

### Critico
Email and landing page editor with a focus on modularity and integrations. 

### Gobbledybook + Bitiotecha
eBook media organizer and streaming library. 


# :last_quarter_moon_with_face: Utility Applications
### Meanie
Simple Docker framework for ready-to-go MEAN-stack application. 

### Fauxyo
Prototyping data generator. 

### Acacia
A Javascript application for converting JSON data into interactive file tree objects. 

### Exemplar
JSON-to-XML converter, developed specifically for saving current application state(s) without necessitating a database. 

### Cauldron
Calendar invitation generator. 

## Upcoming

##### Gershwin
##### Whirlitzer
##### Garbo 
##### Everett

Other Projects I'm working on are currently under the okaybluejay moniker.
