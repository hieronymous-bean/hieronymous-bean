### :ghost: Hello.
The intention here is for this to serve as a centralized repository for any resources, solutions, or materials that I find useful enough to share.<br/><br/>
I'm also intending to use this as a mouthpiece for catharsis, with the goal of [hopefully] achieving some sort of satisfaction through creating.<br/><br/>
I've definitely accumulated a wide swath of knowledge over the past decade or so, and am always working on some project or another, so I'll attempt to document some of it for longevity.
